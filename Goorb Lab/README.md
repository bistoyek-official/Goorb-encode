## Author: Kasra Fouladi

Here is **Goorb Lab** source code, an open source simple cryptography lab\
built with the aim of making it easier to examine the security of various\
encryptions and the effectiveness of various attacks. This attack simulator\
can help people to test their encryption algorithms or their attack algorithms\
much easier.

## Logic

Imagine there is no clue about cryptography but it is guaranteed that the key(s)\
of it won’t change in all of the attack time (clearly now it’s an easier problem),\
attacker has limited amount of supply and there is an oracle that could answer these\
queries:
- For $a$ such $a \in A$ what is $F(a)$. (costs $x$)
- For $b$ that $b \in B$ return $a$ random $a \in A$ which $F(a) = b$. (costs $y$)
